This makes generators particularly efficient for handling large datasets or infinite sequences, as they conserve memory.\n",

When yield is encountered, the function pauses, returns the yielded value, and saves its internal state (including local variables). When the generator is iterated over again (e.g., in a for loop or by calling next()), the function resumes execution from where it left off, continuing until the next yield or until the function finishes."
